This project is part of Task 03 for the SkillCraft Technology Internship. The goal is to build a Decision Tree Classifier that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📌 Overview
Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Repository)
Task: Binary classification (purchase or not)
Model: Decision Tree Classifier
Evaluation: Accuracy score & classification report
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

🔧 Steps Performed
Loaded and explored the dataset
Preprocessed categorical and numerical features
Encoded labels using LabelEncoder
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
Evaluated the model using accuracy and F1-score
Visualized the decision tree structure
